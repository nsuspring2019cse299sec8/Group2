It includes list of the available medicines for specific diseases so that the doctor can easily look for an alternative when in need. The patient can be given an appointment referring to the doctors’ schedule. The use of HMS makes the co-ordination between a doctor and patient easy and hassle free.

1.	How does it function?
	The system is typically presented to the user as a website. The website would allow the users to find their desired doctors based on their search criteria. To book appointments they need to need to sign up first or if they are already registered, then they can simply log in. They need to pay first to confirm the appointment.

	The principal beside user is the patient, who uses it to take appointments. Besides the users there will be a doctors profile.

3.	How to make an appointment?
	To book appointments they need to need to sign up first or if they are already registered, then they can simply log in. The users would be allowed to book appointments only after they have done half of the payment through online banking.

4.	Do you have consultants available 24 hours?
	The visiting hours of all the consultants are given. Of course the time varies from consultant to consultant. Some of them are not available on Friday and on government holidays but the emergency doctors will be available 24 hours.

5.	How secure is the patient data?
	All data is encrypted and the system is password protected.
